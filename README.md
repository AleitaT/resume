# Resume

This is my resume in LaTeX.  Feel free to modify the .tex file to create your own resume.  Please do not distribute these documents without my permission.

# Installation and Compilation

Install Latex and download the moderncv theme. Place the moderncv theme somewhere Latex can find it - you can just place it in the same directory as your `.tex` file:

    /my-resume
        my-resume.tex
        my-resume.pdf
        /moderncv

Simply use the `pdflatex` command in your terminal:

    pdflatex my-resume.tex
